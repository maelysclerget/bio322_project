# Overview 
Confiscated drug samples often require purity analysis for legal and law enforcement purposes. Traditional methods, such as chromatography, are expensive and time-consuming. This project explores cost-effective and real-time solutions using machine learning models to analyze data from portable infrared spectrometry devices. The competition is hosted on Kaggle.

# Installation 

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/username/bio322_project.git

# Usage

1. **Run the Notebook**  
   Open and execute the file `Notebook_final.ipynb`.

2. **Set Your Working Directory**  
   Before running the notebook, update the `path` variable in the notebook to your working directory.  
   Look for the following line in the code:  

   ```python
   # To change, enter your working directory / path
   path = '/Users/maelysclerget/Desktop/ML/bio322_project/'
   ```

   Replace it with the correct path to your project directory. For example:  
   ```python
   path = '/path/to/your/project/'
   ```

3. **Run All Cells**  
   Once the path is updated, execute all cells to preprocess data, train models, and generate outputs.

4. **Folders and Outputs**

	The notebook will automatically create required folders during execution.
	All generated plots will be saved in the results_plots folder for easy access.
