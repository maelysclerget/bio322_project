# Miniproject BIO-322: Predicting Heroin Purity
This repository contains the code, analysis, and results for the BIO-322 miniproject. The goal of this project is to predict the purity level of heroin samples using infrared spectra and machine learning techniques.

# Overview 
Confiscated drug samples often require purity analysis for legal and law enforcement purposes. Traditional methods, such as chromatography, are expensive and time-consuming. This project explores cost-effective and real-time solutions using machine learning models to analyze data from portable infrared spectrometry devices. The competition is hosted on Kaggle.
